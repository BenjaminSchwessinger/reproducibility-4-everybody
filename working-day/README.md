## Plan for working days, R4E group:

1) send out Doodle to find a "best fit" 24h period.

2) send out an availability schedule where people provide their most "tuned in" times.

3) business can be conducted in the Slack team [reproducibilityws.slack.com](http://reproducibilityws.slack.com)

4) we will provide an availability schedule (see #2) and a Zoom meeting space to conduct business.
