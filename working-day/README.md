## Plan for working days, R4E group:  

1) schedule a "best fit" 24h period. This is meant to accomodate people across many timezones, so if you want to work with specific people, plan accordingly.  

* it is best practice to have a plan for what you would like to accomplish prior to the working day. Working days are meant to facilitate small group interactions and meaningful feedback.   

2) send out an availability schedule where people provide their most "tuned in" times.  

3) business can be conducted in the Slack team [reproducibilityws.slack.com](http://reproducibilityws.slack.com)  

4) we will provide an availability schedule (see #2) and a Zoom meeting space to conduct business.  

5) although working days are meant to be of general interest, we expect specialty groups to be particularly active during this time. Those groups are:  

* Group organization  

* Material Development  

* Outreach and Communication  

* Workshops and Training
